# __Accor RVDC - Workshop - System Management__ 
## This workshop is intended to be used as a hand-on experience, gamefied situation for Accor team in order to understand and apply IaC oriented to use AWS SSM, AWS EC2 Image Builder, AWS EC2 and other different components reviewed in previous sessions. 🚀

#The System Management Quest 🧙‍♂️
 
This is a gamified workshop where participants will practice automated deployment and configuration of EC2 windows instances based on a parent image built with EC2 Image Builder on the AWS platform. A set of different actions will be done using AWS SSM to have a final version of a webserver with static content.

##What is the script of the System Management Quest?
The System Management Quest is a competition across multiple teams. The winning team is the one which accumulates the highest number of points. Points come from activities described in the git repository. Some activities are based on time, therefore teams have to be quick on execution. Other activities are based on thinking, therefore teams have to scratch their heads. In all cases, high-degree of collaboration is an important factor of success.
